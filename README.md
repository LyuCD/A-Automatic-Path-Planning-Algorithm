# A-Automatic-Path-Planning-Algorithm
This project implements the classic A* (A-Star) path planning algorithm to enable mobile robots to automatically find the shortest path from a starting point to a target location in a known environment. The algorithm operates on a 2D grid map, using a heuristic search strategy to effectively avoid obstacles and generate an efficient and feasible path.

Through this project, I gained a deep understanding of the principles and implementation of graph-based search algorithms. I also developed practical skills in applying path planning techniques to robot navigation, laying a solid foundation for future integration with SLAM and motion control modules.
